About the Children's Brain Tumor Network
------------------------------------------------------------
The `Children's Brain Tumor Network <https://cbtn.org>`_ (CBTN) seeks to innovate discoveries, to pioneer new treatments and to support open science to improve the health of every child and young adult diagnosed with a brain tumor. Previously, it was named the `Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium <https://cbttc.org>`_ (CBTTC).

About the APOLLO1 Data Set
---------------------------------------------------------------------

CBTN has the Pediatric Brain Cancer Pilot Study available at the `Proteomics Data Commons (PDC) <https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/>`_. ISB-CGC has procured this data through the PDC API.

Accessing the APOLLO1 Data in Google BigQuery
------------------------------------------------

ISB-CGC has APOLLO1 data, such as clinical, stored in Google BigQuery tables. Information about these tables can be found using the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_ with APOLLO1 selected for filter PROGRAM. To learn more about this tool, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search documentation <../BigQueryTableSearchUI.html>`_.

The APOLLO1 tables are in project isb-cgc-bq. To learn more about how to view and query tables in the Google BigQuery console, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Tables documentation <../BigQuery.html>`_.

- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.APOLLO1`` contains the latest tables for each data type.
- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.APOLLO1_versioned`` contains previously released tables, as well as the most current table.
